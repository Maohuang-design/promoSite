                <p>In a world where power and privilege dominate, four men live their lives benefiting from a deeply patriarchal society. The more they indulge in their dominance—controlling others, belittling women, and reinforcing outdated traditions—the stronger a mysterious virus grows inside them.</p>
                
                <p>When the infection reaches its peak, they transform into mindless, violent zombies, spreading the virus to others like them.</p>
                
                <div class="quote">The virus feeds on privilege.</div>
                
                <p>As chaos engulfs the city, a group of survivors discovers that the only cure is self-awareness and change. But can those who have always thrived on power truly let go of it? Or is the virus destined to consume everything in its path?</p>
